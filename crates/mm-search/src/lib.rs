//! # mm-search
//!
//! Search algorithms for finding solution paths through the mathematical
//! transformation space.
//!
//! This crate provides:
//! - [`BeamSearch`] - A simple beam search algorithm (good for v1)
//! - [`NeuralMCTS`] - Neural-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search
//! - [`DeepMCTS`] - Industrial-strength MCTS for 10M+ nodes
//! - [`MCTS`] - Legacy MCTS (delegates to NeuralMCTS)
